It is a lovely day in June. Meera Miss is busy. She has told the children to play on their own. Stella and Parvez are having fun drawing on the blackboard.KU-OOOOH KU-OOOH! “Koel?” asks Parvez. “Yes, but it seems to have a sore throat! I’ve never seen a koel with a sore throat before. Come, let’s go look for it!” says Stella.Stella and Parvez run towards the trees. “This pit is too deep! I can’t jump over it!” says Stella. Parvez holds her hand and they leap across.“Ku-ooo, Ku-ooo!” calls out Stella. “Kkk . . . kkkuh . . . ooh!” whispers Parvez. They look everywhere. But they can’t find the bird with the sore throat.Soon, all their classmates join them in their search. KU-OOOO KU-OOOO! Everybody wants to see the koel with the sore throat.“There!” says Bhanu. “No, no, here!” says Zeba softly. “I can see one on that branch!” points out Uma. “Parvez, look up . . . on that tree!” says Karan. “Oh no, now how do we know which one has a sore throat?” asks Zeba.TUN TUNN TUNN TUN “Lunch time!” yells Bhanu.Parvez can feel his stomach growling. “What is that sound!” jokes Stella. They run inside and open their lunch boxes. “Idli, yay!” says Stella happily. “Mmmm . . . papaa . . . th . . . thaa!” mumbles Parvez, munching a paratha.TUN-TUN-TUN-TUN TUNNN! Parvez picks up his bag and runs to Amina Dadi. She Lunch break is over. is waiting near the gate.“Parvez, you’re not wearing your hearing-aid! You know it will help you hear better, dear,” she says. She pulls out the small machine from his shirt pocket and fixes it to his ear.“I dddon't lllike it,” he mutters. “And I don't like my glasses, but I wear them, don't I?” asks Dadi. Just then, he hears a koel faintly. “Ku-oooh-oooh!” imitates Parvez with a giggle. “Ku- oooooh-ooooooh!” Parvez tells Dadi about the koel with a sore throat as they walk towards Sukarna School for the Deaf.13In the evening, he meets Stella near his house. “Sstellaa, I h . . . h . . . eard dhu koel!” he says, one word at a time. Stella waves both her hands in the air. It means she is clapping. Parvez has taught her many words in Sign Language that he has learnt from Sheela Miss at Sukarna School.“I ththink . . . itssss . . . ththroat . . . got be-tter!” he says. Sheela Miss says his voice too will get better. It may just take a long time. “Catch?” calls Parvez, and off he runs. It is playtime now!16SOME EARS ARE DIFFERENT - When Parvez was just five months old, his parents saw that he didn’t react to loud noises at all. They took him to a doctor who said that Parvez may have hearing loss. The doctor explained how they could help Parvez learn everything just like children who could hear. - When you can hear well, you learn to speak easily too. Most deaf people do not speak very well because they cannot hear others talk.- People who have total hearing loss cannot hear anything. Parvez has partial hearing loss. So he needs a special teacher like Sheela Miss to help him learn sign language, lip-reading, and other ways to communicate. - Some children wear glasses so that they can see better. Parvez wears a hearing aid so that he can hear better. He has to be careful with this little machine.- Parvez understands people better when they speak to him softly, and if they are facing him when they talk. Parvez cannot hear well. But he can see, feel, smell, understand and learn very well, and play catch!
