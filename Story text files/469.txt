“ “What’s for supper?” asked Sam. “It’s a surprise” , said Mama, putting a big pot on the stove.She added a jug of water. Sam was worried. “Are we having water for supper?” he wailed. “It’s a surprise. Wait and see.” replied Mama.“You are still a bit short,” said Mama. “The pot might fall over. But you can help me by fetching things.” “Can I help?” asked Sam. “I could stir.”“Can you bring me an onion, please.” “This doesn’t smell very nice.” “They will taste nice once they are cooked.”“Now I need some tomatoes. No, that is an apple. The tomatoes are also round and red, but you will find them in the fridge.”“Can you bring me potatoes. They are round and brown.” “Is supper ready yet?”“If you are hungry you can eat the apple while you wait.” “What about these?” “No, we won’t need biscuits. We can save those for after supper.”“What’s in the pot?” “It’s a surprise. Wait and see.”“What about this?” “That is a watermelon. It will be too big for the pot.” “See if you can find some spinach. It is also green.”“Please get some bread. No, it won’t go into the pot but on the table.”Mama carried the pot to the table and started to dish up. “What’s in the pot?” asked Sam.“Soup!” My favourite!
