"Happy Birthday, Vishakha! " "This party is awesome, aunty.” said Rohit. Vishakha was happy because many of her friends had come for her birthday party.Vishakha's mother hugged Rohit in response. That is what everybody loved about her. She was affectionate and she loved all the kids like her own. The parents and their kids loved her back. They were always there in her time of need. And so was she."This is the best birthday ever! " exclaimed Vishakha excitedly as all her friends settled down to watch a movie. The movie was about a tiger and his cub that were playing and having fun in the jungle. This movie made Vishakha a bit sad. Why? She didn't know.All of Vishakha's friends left soon after the movie, Rohit was the last one to go. "That was a really nice movie, wasn't it Vish? " asked Rohit. "Oh! I loved it. " said Vishakha happily. "But where is your father? I have never seen him. " Questioned Rohit."Father? Daddy? Dad? Yeah, where is my father? Maa, where is he? " Her mother yawned and said "time for bed, come on kiddo. " "But, but. . . but I want a father too, just like that cub! ""Come on now Vishakha, mommy is tired. Come here and give mommy a goodnight kiss. " "But MAAAAAA! ! ! " "VISHAKHA! " shouted her mother. "Okay Maa. " said Vishakha sadly.The next day school was off. Hence, Vishakha and Rohit sat down and read together. "Where should I look for him, Rohit? Where do you usually look when your father is missing? " "The washroom, that's his favourite hiding spot. That's where I look for my dad. " "I checked but he wasn’t there. Do you know where my father is? " "Umm, I don't know. But this book says that parrots speak and they know-it-all. " "But, I don't have a parrot. " "Oh! I do. Let's go! ""Mirchi, look who is here. " called out Rohit to his parrot. "Ki-Ki-Vishakha" chirped the parrot. "O, Mirchi! Dear Mirchi. Do you know who my father is? Or where is he" "NO! ! ! Is he cute like I am? " "That's what I am asking you. " "Ki-Ki-ka-ka" "Rohit, what does he mean? ""Hello, Vishakha. How are you darling? " said Rohit's mother. "Aunty, aunty do you know where my father is? I was just asking Mirchi about it, but he won't say. " "Haha! Mirchi is a nutcase. You should ask your mother, she will know. " "I tried auntyyyy! But Maa has no idea either. " "Hmm. It is getting late. You should go home. " "Yes I should. Bye aunty. "That evening Vishakha wasn't able to stop thinking about her father. What he looked like, what was his profession and most of all where was he, questions like these kept propping up in her mind. She decided she will talk to her mother. Her mother looked quite different, she couldn't understand why! "Hey Maa! Are you alright? " asked Vishakha softly."Come here Vish, look at these stars! Look how they shine. " "They are adorable Maa. I wish I was a star. " "One day, you will be. Just like your father. " "My father is a star? " asked Vishakha excitedly. "Yes darling, he is. Can you see that star? The one which is the brightest! " "Aah haan. " "Well, that is your father, smiling at you. " "Hello Papa! Maa, can he hear me? " "A little louder will do, Vish. "She smiled at the star, closed her eyes, tried counting the distance and then yelled at the top of her voice, "Come home, Papa. "
