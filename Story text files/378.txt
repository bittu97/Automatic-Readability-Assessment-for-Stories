“I wish I had a HOUSE!” said Mrs Penguin. “I don’t like living in rubbish.” “Dear Mrs Penguin,” said Papa Penguin. “We will build you a palace.”So the Penguin family set to work. “The sand is making me itch,” grumbled Sissie. “I’m hungry,” said Gobbles. “The measurements are wrong,” said Boetie. Mrs Penguin sighed. She was doing all the work.At last the castle was finished. But the tide came in and washed it away. “We’ll try again,” said Papa Penguin.“Come children, we’ll build Mama a mansion from stone.” So the Penguin family set to work.“The stones are heavy,” grumbled Sissie. “I’m still hungry,” said Gobbles. “The measurements are wrong,” said Boetie.At last it was finished. But the wind came up and blew it over. Mrs Penguin was cross. “I’m not doing any more work,” she said.“We’ll try again,” said Papa. “I can’t think of anything,” said Sisi. “It’s too hard.” “We haven’t got any cement,” said Boetie. “You can’t build a proper house without cement.” “I’m hungry,” said Gobbles. Mrs Penguin sighed. She was never going to get her home.“Just look at all this mess,” she said. Then Mrs Penguin had an idea.“Boetie, fetch wood,” she said. “Gobbles, pick up plastic. Papa, fetch the hammer.” All day they worked. “Sissie, find nets.”“I’m tired,” said Sissie. “Keep working,” said Mama. “The measurements are wrong,” said Boetie. “Keep working,” said Mama. “I’m still hungry,” said Gobbles. “Keep working,” said Mama.“It’s going to be wonderful,” said Papa. “You’re doing a good job,” said Mama. So they worked and worked and worked and worked … … and at last the house was finished.“Welcome to your palace,” said Papa. Mrs Penguin clapped her flippers. “Thank you,” she said. “It’s Mrs Penguin’s Perfect Palace.”
