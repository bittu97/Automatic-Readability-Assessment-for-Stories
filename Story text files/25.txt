Long ago, a lion, a fox, an ape and a hyena lived together.The ape and the hyena plotted to harm the fox. They secretly went to meet the lion."Lion, you are much respected, but why don't you have shoes? " the ape asked the lion."You are right. Who can make shoes for me? " asked the lion."The fox can make shoes for you, " replied the hyena."Call the fox, " said the lion. The fox came, and the lion told her to make shoes for him."The best shoes are made from the skins of apes and hyenas, " whispered the fox."I want the finest shoes, " said the lion. So he killed the hyena and the ape. He gave their skins to the fox.The fox was worried that the lion would kill her if she did not make the shoes. She put the skins into the river.The lion became impatient. "Where are my shoes? " he growled. Fox replied, "I am still waiting for the skins to soften. "The next morning, the fox came running from the river. She told the lion, "Someone just like you is guarding the skins. I can't get them! "The lion rushed to the river. He saw his own reflection in the water, and jumped in to fight! The lion drowned, leaving the fox alone.
