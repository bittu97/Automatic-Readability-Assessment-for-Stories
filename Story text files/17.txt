And so many things to buy!Rima looked at everything in wonder.Suddenly… she didn't see her uncle. Where did Uncle go?He was nowhere to be seen! Rima was upset. But she did not lose courage.I know how to find lost things, Rima thought. I will explore the fair and look for Uncle!A crowd was gathered under a tree watching the snake act. Rima called out. But Uncle was not there.Maybe he is buying a doll for me! Rima thought. She ran to the doll shop. Rima called out. But Uncle was not there.Where did Uncle go?Perhaps he has gone to the red merry-go-round, Rima thought. So she ran there.Rima called out. But Uncle was not there. Then Rima saw a man nearby. He was wearing a red panjabi like Uncle's!Rima called loudly, “UNCLE!”The man turned to look at Rima.“Oh, dear. Have you lost your Uncle?” he asked.Rima saw balloons flying above a tree. Near the tree she saw a boy. He was all alone and he was crying. “What happened? " Rima asked. "Why are you crying?” But the boy didn’t stop. “MAAAA! BABAAAA!” he cried.Rima knew just what to do. She took the boy to the closest microphone. "This boy needs our help, " she told the announcer. "Please tell his parents he is right here! "The boy’s parents arrived soon. They were so happy! But where was Rima’s Uncle? Wait… is that. . . “UNCLE!”They rushed towards each other. Uncle said, “Where have you been? I looked everywhere for you.” “I was looking for you! " Rima answered. "But Uncles shouldn't need children to look for them!”
