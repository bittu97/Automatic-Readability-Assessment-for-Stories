Fati was a little girl who ran like the wind, who loved to laugh, and who always tried hard to do as she was told.One day, Fati went with her mother and father to look for firewood.Fati liked to help her mother and father but there was so much to do and so much to see: the birds, the monkeys, the sky!Mother said, “Fati! Please listen! You can look for firewood here and you can look for firewood there. . .. . . but Fati, please watch where you go and be very careful.” She said, “Yes mother.”Soon her mother and father got very busy.They found big pieces of firewood. They found small pieces of firewood.Fati was also very busy. She found small pieces of firewood. She found very small pieces of firewood.Then Fati looked up. She saw a red bird in the tall grass.Next Fati looked down. She saw a brown ant on the dusty path.Then Fati saw a beautiful leaf. The leaf was shiny and green. She put one finger on the beautiful leaf.Fati said, “This does not feel like a leaf.” Suddenly the beautiful leaf moved! Fati said, “This is not a beautiful leaf. This is a green snake!”Fati screamed, “Eii!” Fati ran very fast to look for her mother and father.Fati saw her father. Fati said, “A snake! A snake!” Father said, “Where? Where?” Fati said, “There! There!”Then her father chased the green snake with a stick. The green snake slithered away.Father said, “Fati, you are safe. Let’s go to mother and tell her about the green snake.”Mother said, “Fati, I am happy the green snake did not bite you. . .. . . but next time, please, please, look where you go, and be very careful.” And that was the end of that.
