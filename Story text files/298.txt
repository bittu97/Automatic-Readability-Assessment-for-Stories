Where do my thoughts go?3Do they plip-plop or do they thump-thump when they walk?5Do they spin and spin and spin with the fan and get di-diz-dizzy?7Do they ride on a paper plane to go play with the clouds?9Do they sleep like Raasu all day long when they eat too much?11Do they hide inside Mumma’s bag and secretly go to work with her?13Do they tiptoe around the house looking for a treat?15Do they grow up to be tomatoes if Papa plants them in the soil?17Do they glow when the stars come out?19But wait, I can’t find my thoughts! Did they hide under my bed because they are scared of the dark?21“Be brave!” I think. “It's okay. It's just a little dark.” I go to bed. They come out and curl up in my head.My thoughts go zzzzzzzzz with me.
