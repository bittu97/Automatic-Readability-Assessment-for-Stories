Mom! Can I too, do something?Shall I throw a ball?Shall I carry my baby brother?Or shall I play the Tabla?Or maybe I can ride the bi-cycle!Shall I put on my new dress?Or let me rectify the ball of wool !Shall I water the plants?Shall I feed the baby goat some grass! or shall i draw a picture!Let me go fly a kite?Or shall I just laugh out loud! ! ! ! Ha ha ha !
