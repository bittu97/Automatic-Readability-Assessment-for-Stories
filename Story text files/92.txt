Ma smiled.Masi sang, "Harmonium sure looks like a box, a musical instrument with bellows, keys and stops. You can create melodies with it and sing along, sit on the floor and play your favourite song. ""Tabla always comes in pairs, and brings its own cushion-chairs. It makes beautiful, rhythmic sounds, when you tap your fingers on those rounds. ""Now let's have a look at Sitar, it's popular worldwide, an all-star. Shaped round at bottom with a tall neck, a Sitar has many strings and frets. "Made of bamboo and hollow inside, Bansuri is always by Krishna's side. Blow air to make sound, use fingers to play, You can take a Bansuri anywhere.Masi said, “The sound of this one brings back memories, Remember where you heard its melodies? " Vivaan said, "I heard Shehnai during your wedding celebrations, where everyone kept going, Congratulations! Congratulations! " Ma and Masi burst into laughter."The concert is about to start.
