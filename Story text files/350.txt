Tall like a tree Short like grassUp in the sky is a cloud Down in the soil is an earthwormLight like a petal Heavy like a rockOver the leaf is a caterpillar Under the leaf is a dragonflyQuick as a squirrel Slow as a snailBirds before sunrise Bats after sunsetAbove the tree is the moon Below the tree is you!
