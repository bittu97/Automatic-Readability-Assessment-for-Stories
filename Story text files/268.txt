My name is Eyad. Every morning, dada takes me to the balcony to listen to the birds. Pigeons are my favourite!There are always so many in the sky. Dada says they can carry messages and recognise our faces.Some are white, like my dada’s beard. Some are grey, like my dadi’s hair. Some have shades on their neck. I hope to find out more about them, when I grow up.The pigeons coo when they hear me hum. When I come too close, they fly away in a flock. They flap their wings so hard that some of their feathers fall off.The pigeons do backflips in the air. Does that mean they are happy?I wish I could do backflips too!They poop all over the balcony. That’s why dada hates them!But I do not want the pigeons to leave, I ask dada if I could keep one. “We cannot force them to stay,” dada says. “Birds are meant to fly wherever they want.”“Why can’t I fly?” I ask dada. “We all have special powers,” he says. “Pigeons can fly and see colours that are invisible to us.”“Do I have a special power?” I ask. “Yes,” dada says. “One day you will find it.” “I cannot wait,” I say. “Neither can I,” dada says.12Did you know? Historically, pigeons were used to deliver important messages. That is because they have the amazing ability to return to their homes even when they are thousands of kilometres away in an unknown location. One of the greatest examples is a pigeon named Cher Ami. She was awarded a bravery medal from the French Army for saving 200 people in World War I by delivering a message even though she was injured. A note about pigeons Do not feed pigeons, they can manage by themselves! And like Eyad’s dada says, do not keep birds in cages. They are meant to fly in the sky.
