But Little Cicada could not sing his song.She then visited Mynah. Maybe she could learn to sing Mynah's song.“Keak! Kaek! Kaek!” sang Mynah. But Cicada could not sing Mynah's song.She then visited Cricket. Cicada was determined to learn a new song!“Krik krik krik! Krik krik krik!” sang Cricket. But Cicada could not sing Cricket's song, either.Then it started to rain. The ducks sang, “Quack! Quack! Quack!”Frog came out and croaked, “Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!”All the animals came out. And they all sang their songs. “Doo-oo-oo! Doo-oo-oo!” “Keak! Kaek! Kaek!” “Krik krik krik! Krik krik krik!” “Quack! Quack! Quack!” “Ribbit! Ribbit! Ribbit!”Cicada listened to all the songs.
