There's sweetness in the holidays of juicy mangoes from trees, Of the pleasant cool sensation of unending twilight breeze.Holidays are like scenes from plays of lying awake, pretending to sleep. They are islands of my own kingdom of independence that I can keep.Holidays are gift coupons With an 'off' on studies and A 'bumper sale' on play. They have the tangy taste of 'golgappas' The joy of 'I spy' and 'dhappa's Ah! the taste of a holiday! Holidays- Loose change in a pocket, A trick by schools- and gone like a rocket!That coward-faint hearted slave to calendar days, Perhaps quick melting chocolate best describes our holidays!
