What a sweet smell! Where is it coming from?Not from here! This is the lovely smell of flowers.Not from here! This is the bad smell of cow dung.Eek! This is the yucky-mucky smell of my dirty socks.Mmmm. . . This is the yummy smell of hot luchi-aalu!Aha! That sweet smell is from here! From this new sweet stall. The sweet smell is coming from these fresh gulab jamoons!Dear friends, did you know that the inside of our noses are lined with millions of cells? These cells help us smell things. They help us tell if they are good smells or bad smells. Smell helps us guess the taste of things. The smell of something also tells us how far we are from it.The sense of smell is much stronger in animals than it is in humans. Haven’t you noticed that mosquitoes smell us out, no matter where we are?And who tells the ants about the crumbs that we drop on the floor while eating? Simple. It’s their sense of smell! Everyone knows that dogs have very sharp noses. That’s how they help us find robbers and bombs.So do you know why we take a deep breath when we are passing by a beautiful garden? And why we cover our noses when we are near a garbage heap?Because something is telling us to do so. And that something is our fantastic sense of smell!
