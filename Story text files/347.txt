When the last school bell rang, all the children laughed and screamed with joy. All, except Akku. Akku was ANGRY!"Akku! Akku! Look at the pretty sunflowers! " said Appa, as they rode through a field. "GRRMPH! They’re TOO YELLOW! They’re making my eyes hurt! " said Akku."Akku! Akku! Look! Look at all the monkeys! " said Appa, pointing at the roof of their house. "CHEEE! " said Akku. "SHOOO! Go AWAY! SHOOO! "5"Here, drink some buttermilk, " said Appa. "It’ll cool you down. " "HRRRM! " said Akku. "I DON’T WANT ANY! " "Try a sip, at least? " "OKAY! FINE! " said Akku, and tried a sip. It wasn’t all that bad. She had another sip. And another. In no time, the glass was empty."Would you like a vada? " asked Appa. "FFEHH! " said Akku. "Just one little bite? " "Okay, FINE! " said Akku, and took a bite. It was quite good. She took another bite. And another. In no time, the plate was empty."Good girl, " said Appa. "Now will you tell me why you’re so angry? " "NO! " said Akku. "Was it something I did? " "NO! " "Was it something Amma did? " "NO! " "Did something bad happen in school today? " "MAYBE! " "Oho. ""Would you like to draw it? " asked Appa. "Here’s a nice sheet of paper and some crayons. " "Okay, FINE! " said Akku.Akku drew a brick… "This is the STUPID BRICK that I tripped over this morning, " said Akku. "You’re right. That IS a VERY STUPID brick! " said Appa.And Akku drew a boy… "This is Bikku, a VERY BAD BOY! He laughed when I fell down! " said Akku. "You’re right, " said Appa. "He shouldn’t have laughed at you. "And Akku drew an idli… "This is my idli, " said Akku. "It fell out of my lunch box when I tripped over the STUPID BRICK! "And Akku drew a crow… "This is the VERY BAD CROW that flew off with my idli, " said Akku. "The crow must have been very hungry, " said Appa.And Akku drew her teacher… "This is my teacher, Amala Miss, " said Akku. "She helped me up when I fell down. And then she hugged me. " "That’s nice of her, " said Appa. "And then she pinched my cheeks. I DON’T LIKE IT when my cheeks are pinched. " "Oho! That must have HURT, no? " "A little bit. But I’m okay now. " "That’s good. ""See how well you draw, Akku? " said Appa. "You’re a real artist! Will you draw something for Amma too? " "OH-kay! " said Akku, and started drawing some more. "This is a little white mouse… and this is a boat… and this is a coconut tree…""And this is a sunflower… and this is your cycle, Appa… and this is a dog… and this is a frog…" In no time, Akku had forgotten all about the STUPID BRICK that made her trip and fall. And about the BAD BOY who laughed at her. And about the IDLI-STEALING CROW. And Akku even forgot about being ANGRY.10 Things to Do If You Feel ANGRY like Akku: 1.
