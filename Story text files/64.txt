Muniya and Raju were flying a kite. It had three colours. The kite soared high in the sky. It got caught in a tree.Muniya tugged hard to get it out. The string broke. The kite was stuck in the tree.Raju got a bamboo pole. He stood on his toes to try and reach the kite. But the bamboo pole just fell short.The kite did not budge but many mangoes fell to the ground because of the bamboo. Sweet and sour ones. Raju and Muniya began to eat the mangoes. Slurp! They were both happy now. There came a strong gust of wind. The kite flew away.A bird was giving flying lessons to her young chicks. The chicks were a little scared. The mother bird said, “Don’t worry. Just grab the string of the kite.”The little chicks held the string of the kite in their beaks. The flying lesson turned out to be fun! “Wow! We are flying!” As they opened their beaks to twitter, they let go of the string. They flapped their little wings joyfully.The kite gently floated down to the ground. A rabbit spotted the tri-coloured kite. He wanted to hold it in his paws.But his claws tore the flimsy kite.The rabbit began to cry.His mother said, “Don’t cry. We’ll turn the kite into something else.”Mother rabbit made pretty buntings with the kite and strung them on the doorway. The rabbit hopped with joy.
