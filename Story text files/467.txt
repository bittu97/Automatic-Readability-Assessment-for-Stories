“I’m so tired!” yawned Eli as he stretched to the skies “I need a nap!” he said, rubbing his eyes “Somewhere snuggly to curl up in a ball…” He looked all around, and then began to crawlOut into the garden where he found a leaf pile. He nestled down with a happy smile. But just as he closed his sleepy little eyes. . . Around him buzzed a swarm of flies “Go away! Stop buzzing, I’m trying to nap!” But no they didn’t stop, they went Flap flap flap…Sleepy little Eli crawled back inside, In a dappled corner, a stack of books he spied He climbed on top and rested his head “This is rough. And hard. .” he sleepily said.“Books are only meant to be read. . . They’re just not soft enough to make a bed”Shhh…ever so quietly, Eli nuzzled his fur And Toby the dog, didn’t even stir. But… “Ahh-ahhh- Aaaachooo” , Toby woke with a jolt Off darted the furry pillow, quick as a boltWhere oh where is the best place to doze? Eli thought and thought as he twiddled his toes Somewhere dark and warm, is there such a place? Hmmm, maybe inside Dad’s guitar case…The shape was all wrong, the case way too small “Oh gosh, I really am tired now…” Eli started to bawl Eli was lifted from the floor so high, By a warm pair of hands and a lullabyThree hours later Eli’s eyes open wide. He had fallen asleep, and he hadn’t even tried! He stretched and yawned and he started to clap “I found it! It’s true! ""Grandpa's lap is the best place to nap!”
