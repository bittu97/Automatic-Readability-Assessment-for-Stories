My friends and I are staging a play.The monkeys are getting their long, brown tails fixed.The writers are helping Sher Singh and Rani remember their lines. “I am going to eat you,” growls Sher Singh. “No no! Eat the gulab jamun instead,” said Rani.The palace guards and dancers are practising their dance. The dance teacher is helping them.Oh no! A dancer has tripped over the guard’s spear.The first aid team rushes in. Everyone is fine. Phew!The audience is coming into the hall. We are so nervous!But I cannot see my family! Where are they?Uh oh! My moustache is falling off. The play is about to start. What shall I do?There they are! I can see my family.Wait and watch – I will be the best Rajah ever!
