Sona’s uncle was a chuski maker. Some people call an ice-candy ‘chuski’. Some people call it ‘gola’. One day, Sona went to Uncle’s house to see how he made chuski.Uncle was trying to make syrups of different colours and flavours. He was getting them ready in four huge vessels. “Uncle, let me also help you make the syrups!” said Sona.“No, no, Sona! Why don’t you just sit and watch me working?” Uncle added a colour and essence to one vessel. “Ah-hh-h, that smell goes straight to my throat! That is kala-khatta, right?”“You are right, Sona. That gives the chuskis a tangy taste,” said Uncle. “But I can smell something else too. Not a good smell!” said Sona.Uncle added a flavour to another vessel. Sona took a deep breath. “Ah, this is an earthy-sweet smell! Pomegranate chuski!”“Wow, Sona, you are right again!” said Uncle and went to another vessel. “But I can still smell something that is not nice!” said Sona, holding her nose.“Now, I am adding the rose flavour here,” said Uncle and he stirred the liquid in the third vessel. “Does it smell nice and sweet?”“Something is burning, Uncle!” shouted Sona, suddenly. “I think something is stuck to the bottom of the vessel!”Uncle looked around. The milk was boiling in one vessel. He quickly took it off the stove.“Good job, Sona!” said Uncle, as he poured the milk into another clean vessel. “You have saved the rabdi* chuski! The milk had just begun to catch.” *thickened milk sweet dish.Uncle gave the very first rabdi ice-candy to Sona. He patted her on her back lovingly and said, “Our very smart Sona!”
