Maaloo went to his Nani’s place with his dog, Kaaloo. Nani’s house was in the hills.When he got there, Nani said, “Maaloo, there are strange sounds coming from the garden these days. Keep the doors of the house shut.”At once, Maaloo took out his detective’s bag. He pulled out his binoculars and went into the garden. He looked at each tree, plant and creeper very carefully.Suddenly, he spotted a big beehive on a tree in the corner of the garden.Maaloo ran to Nani. “Nani, there are so many bees buzzing around the mulberry tree.” “Right Maaloo. But even a thousand bees cannot make the heavy sounds I have heard,” said Nani. “This could only be a thief. . . or a ghost!”Maaloo picked up a long stick and made his way to the garden again. Kaaloo started going round and round on the grass with his nose to the ground… ghoon ghoon ghoon.“Kaaloo, stop all this drama. Don’t spoil the grass,” Maaloo called out. But Kaaloo wagged his tail very hard and kept going in circles there.Maaloo ran to Kaaloo. He looked at the grass and found big paw prints. These were the tracks of a bear! “Very good Kaaloo, you have found the Bhaaloo!”Kaaloo and Maaloo ran to Nani.“No thief, no bandit, nor a ghost is it,” said Maaloo.“A bear comes to visit. Honey and mulberry are his favourite!”
