I am happiest among the big trees of a forest. Flying snakes scare me – they might gobble me up! I am a flying lizard. Where am I?3I am shy and quick-footed. Guess what? I eat my own potty! I am a black-naped hare. Where am I?5I have a very small body and really long legs. My tail looks like it’s split down the middle. I am a two-tailed spider. Where am I?7I am hidden among leaf litter. My wings have a special pattern! I am a moth. Where am I?9I spend all my life on trees in gardens. When tiny insects come near me, I leap forward and eat them up! I am a bark gecko. Where am I?11I love eating juicy, green leaves. Watch out for an odd-shaped leaf – that might just be me! I am a grasshopper. Where am I?13I have eight legs but I don't spin webs. The flower I live in is the same colour as me! I am a crab spider. Where am I?15I can sit still for hours on end. Listen for my chirps, mostly during dawn or dusk! I am a nightjar. Where am I?17I hold up my front legs in a fold, like I am praying. Look for a swaying movement and you will know it's me. I am a praying mantis. Where am I?19I spend a lot of time near water. When you hear us call "drong drowng", you know the monsoon has arrived! I am a bullfrog. Where am I?21
