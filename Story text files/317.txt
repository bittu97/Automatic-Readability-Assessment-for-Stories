Gurru and Peechu the dog love to play. They play ball and run along side by side.Gurru and Peechu go to their room to play. "Peechu, don’t make a mess in the house. Gurru, take him outside, " scolds a very angry Mummy.Gurru and Peechu go outside to play. "Gurru, how much noise do you both make? Shush!” yells a very irritated Manohar Uncle.Gurru and Peechu go to the park to play. "Gurru! Peechu isn't allowed here. Come on… Leave now… Shoo! " complains a very cranky Madhusudan Ajoba."Where can we play, Peechu? " Gurru says sadly, staring at the sea. "Oh yes! I know where we can go. "Gurru and Peechu go to the beach to play. Both Peechu and Gurru stick their tongues out and gleefully enjoy the wind against their faces. No one says "Peechu, don't! " No one says "Gurru, take Peechu somewhere else. ""Fetch, Peechu! " Gurru throws their red ball. The ball rolls towards the sea. Peechu runs after it, straight into the water."No, Peechu! Don't go there! Come back, " Gurru yells. But Peechu's furry head is already disappearing into the water.Gurru starts crying. Every memory with Peechu flashes before his eyes.“Bhow bhow!” Peechu paddles through the water proudly carrying the ball. "Peechu, I didn't know you could swim, " says Gurru. "Bhow bhow! " replies Peechu as if she always knew she could swim.Gurru and Peechu now go to the beach every day. They play ball. They run along side by side. They also play among the waves, jumping and splashing water at each other.
