Today, I am an astronaut.Look how high I can jump on the moon.Today, I am a sculptor.Watch out, my crocodile and dinosaur are hungry. Rawrrr!Today, I am a cricketer.It is my turn to bowl. And… you are OUT!Today, I am a botanist.I’ve discovered a new plant. I’ll name it after myself.Today, I am a drummer.Dhushh! Tsshh! My sticks are moving so fast, you cannot even see them.Today, I am so many things. Tomorrow, what will I be?
