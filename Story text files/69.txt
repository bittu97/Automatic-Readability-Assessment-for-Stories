Many, many years ago, there was a good king in Myanmar called King Anawrahta. He wanted to build a pagoda, a temple for the Buddha. The King sent out his white elephant. “Mark the place where the white elephant stops. We will build a pagoda on that spot!” the King said to his people.The white elephant stopped on top of a hill. “Let us build a pagoda to Lord Buddha right here!” said the King.Soon the pagoda rose high, filling the sky. The King lifted his head to look up at the tippy tippy top and thank the Lord. DHUPP! His crown rolled off! Everyone was nervous. They picked it up and gave it back to the King.The King visited the pagoda every day. He found that he could look up till the doorway of the pagoda. But when he tried to move his gaze upwards, DHUPP - his crown would not stay on his head!That night the King could not sleep. So many people would come to see the tall pagoda. Would it be nice if their hats fell down every time they looked up? He had to solve the problem.The next morning he called the builder of the pagoda. Smiling at him, the King asked him to build a small pool of water.The next day, when the King went to the pagoda, he looked down into the pool of water. Lo! The lovely tall pagoda was seen in the reflection. The King was happy. His crown was on his head and he could see the entire pagoda!
