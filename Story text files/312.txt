My name is Mary. This is where I live.3Today is a new day. That means it’s time to do the washing.5Everyone’s arms are covered in bubbles.7Grace Aunty washes her uniform. Tomorrow she will wear it to her clinic.9Soapy puddles make rainbows in the streets.11Jauna Aunty hangs up the blanket her grandmother wove in her village. The yarn is dyed the colours of Jauna Aunty’s home.13Fatima Aunty’s line is draped with scarves. They will smell sweet when she wraps them around her head.15Zakir Chacha’s autowalla uniform hangs outside his house. He sews a missing button onto the clean shirt.17At Geetha Aunty’s house, cotton saris sway in the breeze. They sound like birds flapping their wings.19Joseph Uncle’s line is covered with socks. They keep his feet warm during his shift as a security guard.21My brother, David, and I start washing our school uniforms. We scrub away the ink stains on the pockets and the chalk dust on the sleeves.23Tomorrow, our clothes will get dirty again. But right now, everything is clean.25
