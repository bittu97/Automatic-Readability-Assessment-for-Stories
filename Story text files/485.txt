Simba was now nine months old. And he had decided it was time for him to be a real watch dog. He would stay awake all night and guard his family. But then he needed to sleep during the day. Where could he sleep without being disturbed?His first thought was the kitchen. Mother was tolerant and she whipped wonderful smells. But the thought of the shrill pressure cooker, the grinding of teeth of the mixer and the sputtering of mustard seeds- who could sleep through these sounds?Father’s room was out of the question- Father was strict about rules and he kept the door to his room shut. Father did not trust Simba!One day he slipped into the laundry basket- it was wonderful. Full of the smells of his family. He secretly wondered why humans shed their skin so quickly, every day practically. But Bina, the maid upset his cosy plans when she picked up the basket and up-ended the contents on to the floor.His attempts to sleep peacefully were all in vain. How could a house of four members, of whom two left every morning, be so noisy and unsafe for a poor dog? The drawing room was frequently disturbed by the calling bell; the bathroom was no place for a decent dog. And the bedrooms were not kept open for Simba.A week after this futile search for a cosy corner, Mother kept calling Simba. She couldn’t find him anywhere. He had not gone out, so where could he be? It was only by mid-morning she realized where the cunning little pup was. He was curled up on an old, empty sack, in a corner of the storeroom!Mother gently closed the store room door, remembering to leave it a little ajar for the poor tired mite who took his guard duties so seriously.
