They can float around in the air that we breathe, and sit on things we touch. When these viruses get into your nose and throat, they give you a sore throat, or a headache, or a clogged nose -- or even all three at the same time! A cold can move very quickly from you to your friends. If you touch your friends when you have a cold, or sneeze or cough near them, they too will fall sick. Did you know that a single cough or sneeze can shoot your nose and throat viruses 12 feet through the air? How terrible!This is how you can avoid catching a cold: Stay far away from anyone who has a bad cold. If you meet or shake hands with someone who has a cold, wash your hands well. Otherwise, the virus will travel from your hands to your nose. Do not share drinking glasses, eating utensils or clothes with someone who has a cold. Eat lots of vegetables and fruits, drink plenty of water, exercise, keep warm and stay healthy!
