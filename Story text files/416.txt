On a very hot day, on a holiday day, we go to the beach. To the sea. We go to the sea, my family and me.On the edge of the sand is the water. That’s where my toes touch the sea.The waves play a game. They say yes, I say no. They run up to meet me, and I run from the sea.They say no, I say yes. I run back to the edge. I chase the waves home to the sea.They say yes, I say no. They say no, I say yes. The sea chases me, and I chase the sea.There is blue. There is sea spray. In the game, I can’t be still.A chasing wave brings me a shell. It leaves it for me on the wet sand.I find a feather in the dry sand, and I send it on a wave to the sea.Then the waves say yes, and I say yes too.I have sea and sand in my toes.Oh, I love the sea.
