My Amma tells me a story every night.There is one story about a frog which talks.There is another story about a king with a long beard.Sometimes it is about a flying elephant.In one story a fox and a tiger are friends. The tiger falls into a hole.How will the tiger get out?Then the clever fox saves the tiger. This is the best story. I listen to the story and then fall asleep.
