Nina is going on her first train ride!But she is not happy at all. Her family is moving from Kolkata to New Delhi.“Do we really have to move?” Nina asks. “All my friends and Nani-Nana are going to miss me. Where will I find the perfect puchkas? Why can’t you find another job in Kolkata, Baba?”“Don’t be sad, Nina,” says Baba. “You will make new friends, and find a new puchkawalla.” But Nina doesn't want to listen. Ma and Baba try to cheer her up.“Would you like some ice cream in a cup?” “Ice cream in a cone?” “Ice cream on a stick?” “Cucumbers?” “Toffees?” “No! I said no!” Nina shakes her head.Ma and Baba do not know what else to do. Then Baba smiles. “I see a. . .” begins Baba. “Oooh! My favourite game,” says Ma.“I see something that is brown,” says Baba.“My shoes? The hills? The suitcase?” asks Ma.“Suitcase is correct!” Baba says, clapping. Nina puts down her book and starts listening.“My turn,” says Ma. “I see something that is yellow.” “Mustard field!” says Baba. “My hairband!” says Nina. “Correct,” Ma claps for Nina.Nina laughs and joins in. “I see something blue.” “The sky!” says Ma.“I see something brown,” says Ma. “That hill!” says Baba. “I see something white,” says Baba. “A cow!” says Nina.“I see something green,” says Nina “Grass!” reply Ma and Baba. “I see something black,” says Ma. “A crow!” says Nina.“I see a tall animal with brown spots,” says Baba. “Huh! You saw a leopard?” asks Ma. “No, a giraffe!” says Baba. Nina looks out of the window and yells, “Giraffes do not live in India! You cheated, Baba.” Everyone starts laughing.Baba and Ma spread a blanket on their seat. They fluff up a pillow for Nina. “Can we play this game again when we reach Delhi?” Nina smiles. “I am sure it will be even more fun to play this game in a new place!”
