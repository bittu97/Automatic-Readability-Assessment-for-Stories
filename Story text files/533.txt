Flying across the morning sky, Are birds in a hungry mood. Spot the one who has caught, A yummy worm for its food!Butterflies of different colours, Are flitting flower to flower. But there’s one that stands out, Because it’s one colour all over.A cheerful bunch of kites, Are merrily hopping about. But one’s not quite the same, Can you find the odd one out?Big and small squares, Are shapes you see everywhere. There’s one grill that’s different, Where is it hidden, here or there?Look among the green leaves, Of this big, old tree. There’s a branch with a speck of colour, Wherever can it be?Planes flying across the sky, Leave behind a straight trail. But one of them is rather odd, And instead makes a curvy tail.A line of chattering birds, Are sitting above, can you see? But one likes to be quiet, Whoever could it be?A flock of white clouds, Are gleaming on a bright summer day. But one decides to be rainy, And doesn’t care what the others say.A long day is done, And the night has just begun. Of all the street lights, Find the one shining like the sun.Bats sleep when the sun is out, And wake up when it's night. Can you find the odd one, Who is still sleeping tight?Outer space has many planets, That are shiny and brightly lit. Spot the one that’s unique, Because it has a ring around it.
