I love going for walks. Especially with my Pishi.I like it when Pishi holds my hand. But I like it even more… when she lets it go.We never walk fast. We often stop to say hello to…a dog, a cat, a rat, a crow, a tree.Pishi loves picking up flowers from the street. I love picking up stones. Big ones, small ones, round ones, flat ones.But the best are the really tiny ones. So tiny, they get lost in my pocket.My pockets are full of things after my walks with Pishi.Today, Ajji gave me a pod of peas from her basket.Dilip bhau gave me this clip from his magical shop.Nirmal didi gave me this sticker for quietly waiting, waiting and waiting.Anjum aunty gave me this button from her big button jar.When I get home, I’ll empty my pockets and keep it all in my yellow box.If I find the tiny stone in my pocket, I’ll give it to my Pishi.
