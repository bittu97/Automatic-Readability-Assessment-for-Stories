Roti is a circle.Bread pakoda is a triangle.Barfi is a square.Chakli is a spiral.Vada is a ring.Patishapta is a cylinder. Patishapta is a Bengali sweet dish made of refined flour, coconut and jaggery.Pomfret is a hexagon, when cut from the middle.Dosa is a cone, when folded from the end.Halwa has no shape. It takes the shape you give it.They all come together and become a food monster.I chase the food monster around the plate. And eat it with a chomp, a crunch, a crackle and a smack!
