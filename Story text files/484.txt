Muzi loves to build things. He dreams of building the best thing ever.Once, he built a shelter for his toys.But it wasn’t the best thing ever.Yesterday he built a bridge for his animals. It was a good thing. But not the best…Today Muzi is going to visit uGogo.He is sad. Without his toys, how can he build the best thing ever?At the bus stop, Muzi is amazed.He sees red things and blue things. Small things and big things. New things and old things.Muzi has a new idea for building the best thing ever.On the road to uGogo’s, Muzi finds many things.Long things and short things. Round things and square things.By the riverside, Muzi finds more things.Soft things and pointy things. Green things and brown things."Look, Muzi! We are here. "While uGogo bakes for the hungry travellers…Muzi builds.Look uGogo, a new house for you. Oh, Muzi, laughs uGogo. This is the best thing ever!uGogo, uGogo! says Muzi. The world is full of toys. Look what I can build.20
