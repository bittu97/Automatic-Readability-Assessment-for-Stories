Tig’s mom is a scientist. She knows things.Tig’s dad is a writer. He makes things up.Tig has a globe. “Mom, if the world is round, why don’t the people on the bottom fall off?”“Because gravity pulls everyone towards the middle of the Earth.”“Wherever you go, the Earth feels like it is below you. Unless you go into space. Then there’s no down at all, and you float!”“People on the other side of the Earth think that they are the right way up. . . . . . and we are upside down! Isn’t that amazing!”“Dad, if the world is round, why don’t the people on the bottom fall off?”. . . and ended up on Saturn.” “Oh, they used to! A lot of people fell off. . .“But some people got caught in the branches of trees. They climbed up to the ground, and dug tunnels so they could get around without falling.”“Now they’ve built upside-down houses, and they swing between them on ropes!”Tig is pretty sure someone is making things up.But that’s OK.
