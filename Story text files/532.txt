My name is Jilly. Today, I hugged most of the cats in town!I hugged the neighbour’s cat, Ben. MEOW? Ben said, “Meow?”I hugged the cat who lives under the bench in the park. He squiggled and he wriggled.I hugged Mrs Lilly’s tubby, ginger cat.He licked my face. “Slurp, slurp, slurp.” SLURP!I hugged the cat who eats outside the fish and chips shop. He went, “Om nom nom.”I even hugged the grumpy cat who doesn’t like hugs! He yowled and yowled.I hugged a long cat. I hugged a short cat.I hugged an old cat. I hugged a young cat.I hugged a mommy cat, and every kitten she had.I tried to hug the big cats at the zoo, but the zookeeper said, “NO!”I climbed on the bus and hugged the cat that was hiding in an old lady’s bag. The old lady shrieked! SHRIEK!I went home and got into bed. YAWN! Some furry things snuck in. . .. . . and hugged me.16
