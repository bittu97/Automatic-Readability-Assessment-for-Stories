Sonu, Monu and Rina set out to play. They saw a kitten.She was looking at a big rat. "Oh look! " shouted Sonu.Rina saw a tiny ant going towards the big rat.Suddenly, a very big shadow fell upon them all.A very big eagle came down to the wall. A tiny ant, a small kitten, a big rat and a very big eagle in the same long street!What would the three clever children do now?They clapped their little hands! The eagle spread its big wings and flew away.Rina made the ant climb onto a leaf. She left the leaf on the wall. The ant saw a grain of sugar. She picked it up and ran home.The big rat picked up a half-eaten pakoda and went back into the drain. The small kitten said 'miaaww' and started licking her paw.Monu got her some milk in a cup. The three kids played with her.The very big eagle sitting on the tree blinked and flew far away.
