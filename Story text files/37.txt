A Saturday morning in Nepal. A special day for the community. It is time to do a roadside planting. Everyone comes to help.Some dig holes for the plants. They use shovels and axes to break up the ground.Others fill each hole with a plant. They cover the roots of the plant carefully.Men from the community come to plant the roadside.Women from the community come to plant the roadside.Some of them are old.Some of them are young.They put each little plant in the ground one at a time.All the community comes.They get the little plants from a wagon. See the man who drives the wagon?It is hard and hot work. But everyone works together.All finished! A job well done. Congratulations! Dedicated to my friends in Bharatpur, Nepal.
