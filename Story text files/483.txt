I like playing with my friend Chuma.We are good friends. When either one of us is sent somewhere, we go together.One day, my grandmother sent me to the shop to buy salt and cooking oil. I went with Chuma.On the way, we saw our friends playing football."Ah! Football! " I said. I wanted to play too.I said to Chuma, "Let's ask if we can play with them. I like playing football very much. "Chuma replied, "Let us go to the shop first, then we can come to play. "But I replied, "Let us play first! " "Grandmother will not allow us to return. "We joined our friends to play. I was the goal keeper. The goal posts were made of two big stones.I worked hard to catch the ball. My friends were not able to score any goals.We played until the field was full of sand.Then we went to the shop. Grandmother's money was gone! I started to cry. Chuma shouted, "Stop crying. You wanted to play first. "We returned home without salt or cooking oil. We were very dirty and worried.Grandmother was annoyed when we got home. The first question she asked us was, "Where were you all this time? "We had to tell her the truth. She forgave us but warned, "Never again go to play without permission. "We went to feed the ducks. Later on, we cleaned ourselves.
