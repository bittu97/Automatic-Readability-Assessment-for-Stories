Let’s play a game.”Jeenu is excited. What game will Ajji play? Ajji draws a shape. “Can you guess what this is?” she asks. “It is a circle.” Jeenu makes a face. She does not like this silly game.“Yes, but it is also something more,” says Ajji. Jeenu thinks, then she smiles. “It is a smiley face!” she says. Ajji claps. “You understood the game!”“Look at what I have drawn!” says Jeenu. Activity: What can you draw with three circles?Ajji draws another shape. “A triangle!” Jeenu shouts. Then she laughs.“Look what I have made!”“Well done, Jeenu!” says Ajji. “Look who has come to play with us!” Activity: What can you draw with three circles and four triangles?Ajji draws a shape with four sides. “Is it a rectangle?” Jeenu asks. “Look carefully. All the sides are the same length.” “It is a square! Hmmm. . . see Ajji, I have drawn a window.”“Do you want a tree near your window?” asks Ajji. “Yes Ajji, thank you!” says Jeenu. She looks at all the chalk drawings. Can she paint them now? Activity: What can you draw with a triangle and a rectangle?Soon, Jeenu holds up her painting. “Ah, so many circles and triangles and squares!” says Ajji.“Yes, but it is also something more, Ajji! It is a bird flying to its home in a tree. And guess who is coming to lunch? Her best friend, Mr. Giraffe!”“That’s so clever, Jeenu!” Ajji exclaims. Jeenu wants to draw some more.
