What is that? What is that doof-doof-doof noise? A cat? A mouse? A visitor in the house?No, it’s something even furrier than a cat, even cuter than a mouse, and much tinier than you and me.It’s the three Doof-Doofs. These sweet creatures have only one foot each to hop on. And each hop makes a thumping doof-doof on the floor.AHHHH UHHH!Here is Solly Doof, the smart one, who is always thinking looooong and loud. He uhhs and ahhs and doof-doofs all night long.He reads daytime stories to the other Doof-Doofs, because unlike you and me, that is when they sleep. Thinky, stinky Solly Doof prefers reading over bathing any time.And here is Sally Doof, the smallest and sweetest Doof-Doof of the three. In a little quiet voice, she sings doobee-doobee Doof-Doof songs, when it gets a bit too quiet in the night.She likes finding shiny things and cuddles. Snuggly, huggly Sally Doof who loves to sing. Clink Clank Clunk!Don’t forget Silly Doof, the funniest Doof-Doof in the house. He is always joking. Hahahahaha!Wiggly, giggly Silly Doof will make you laugh until your tummy hurts. He cheers up the other Doof-Doofs whenever they feel sad.He loves to dance on his big silly foot, to the songs that Sally Doof sings.So, if at night you ever hear a strange doof-doof noise again, remember, it’s just the three Doof-Doofs, reading, singing and dancing on their one doof-doof foot.So sleep well, little one. Or keep one eye open. . .Because maybe, just maybe, you’ll see three cute little creatures hopping past on one foot, going doof-doof-doof.
