Choo Choo! It's midnight, and a train is traveling swiftly through the dark. She is a cheerful train who always has a smile on her face.Past a tree, under a bridge, the train leaves trams and buses in her dust. Soon she is passing fields and lakes, laughing as she goes.There's no stopping her! She chugs along through the next day, taking no rests. CLANK CLANK, the train says, smiling broadly. CLACKITY CLACK!Eventually, the train arrives in a far away land. She begins to get a little scared, slowing down as she passes strange people making strange faces. The smile fades from her face.It's night again and the train is farther than she's ever been before. She wants to rest for a while, but in this dense forest of elephants, shebegins to fear for her life.Suddenly, a nearby bush starts to shake! The train gives a terrified shout! Out pops a little boy, smiling happily.He holds a magic flute and begins to play. The sweet notes help the train feel better. As he plays his tunes, she feels herself becoming a little braver.The train dances around the boy, cheerful once again. The boy plays all through the night. The train and all the forest animals dance for hours.By the next day, the train is feeling happy once again. Thanks to the boy and his flute, she is ready to continue her journey, with a smile on her face!
