Have you met my Aaji? Everyone says that my Aaji has a tail.Mumma says it even does a pirouette, when Aaji sings my favourite song. Aaji’s tail follows her all day long, I wonder why I haven't seen the tail yet?Papa says the tail is growing long and strong. The tail even answers Aaji's phone, when she gets a call. What! Why haven't I seen the tail yet?My teacher says the tail helps Aaji a lot. The tail even helps water the plants in the pots. Sigh! Why haven’t I seen the tail yet?The bus driver says the tail sits next to Aaji in the bus. The tail imitates everything that she does. Someone please tell me, why haven't I seen the tail yet?One day I asked Aaji, "Everybody says that you have a tail. But why haven't I seen the tail yet? "Aaji laughed out loud. She pulled out her phone. Look! It's me. And that's me, it's me again. It's me everywhere!Now I know why everyone says that my Aaji has a tail. Because it was always me following Aaji on her small and big trails.
