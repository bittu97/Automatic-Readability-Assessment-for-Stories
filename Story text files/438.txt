Her chosen career is as a professional pilot, she has worked in a variety of aviation capacities from instruction to airline flying, and is the author of several aviation text books. Danielle started writing children's books as a creative outlet from the stress of her 'day job' and as a break from the sometimes monotonous work required for her professional writing. She began with the Mac and Dipper series, aimed at 5-10 year olds, inspired by two of her own dogs. After having children of her own, she suddenly found she had a muse, an eager resource for test reading, and, by benefit of age, an honest critic. It was fun and rewarding to write creative stories to match her children's learning curve. Danielle prefers to write for the 'learning to read' group, centred around a reading age of 4 to 6 years. Because of her passion for children's literature, and the role it plays in literacy standards, all of Danielle's books are available free in ebook versions. This also led Danielle to create the website 'Free Kids Books' to share free good quality childrens books with the community, in contribution to improved literacy standards world wide.
