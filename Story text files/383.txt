My name is Tumi and I am scared.Mama says it’s okay to be scared. “Everybody gets scared.”What if there is a monster under my bed?“Then I will tell it to go away and NEVER come back.”What if there are eyes in the bath tub drain?“Then your big sister, Kamo, will pull you out of the bath.”What if a whale swallows me at the beach?“Then Kamo and I will swim into the whale’s mouth to rescue you.”What if I can’t sing ABC and the other kids laugh at me?“Then Teacher Jill will help you remember.”What if I’m scared of going to the dentist tomorrow?“I will be right there holding your hand.” Everybody gets scared. Mama says it’s okay.
