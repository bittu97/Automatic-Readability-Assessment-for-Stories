Amma is visiting Nani. Tara and Mini are waiting for her. ‘What will she bring back this time? ’ they wonder.The street is flooded with water. Tara and Mini can’t wait to float their boats!Honk! Honk! A taxi stops at the corner. Amma is back. “When did you get a boat?” she asks. “When the street got flooded with water,” Mini says.“And how did the street get flooded with water?” Amma asks. “Because there wasn’t enough place for the water in our house,” says Tara.“Why didn’t you use buckets to hold the water?” Amma asks. “How could we? The water was rushing and gushing out of the pipe!” says Mini. “It was splashing and washing the floor,” adds Tara.“The pipe! How did it break?” Amma asks. “CRACK!” says Mini. “When Baba hit it to get the tap working properly,” says Tara.“The water went crashing and falling down the stairs!” says Mini. “It flowed out of the house and flooded the street.”Amma races into the house, and bursts into the bathroom. The house is ringing with the sound of water rushing and gushing.Amma opens her toolkit. There are many things in there - a hammer, a wrench, screwdrivers, and a tape.Amma twists and turns things. She knocks and mends. Finally, there is silence. The rushing sound of water stops.Mini and Tara ask, “What did you bring us?” Amma has brought them toolkits. “These are just like yours, Amma,” says Mini.“What can we do with this?” Tara asks. “Anything,” Amma smiles. “You can fix your bicycle, make a rocket fly or. . . stop the water rushing and gushing and flooding the street!”
