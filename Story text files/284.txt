"Tara, it's nearly bedtime! Where were you? " Ma asked angrily.Tara replied, "You know that tall tree just outside our school? I climbed it. It’s sooooo high, it touches the sky! ""When I looked down, there were cushions of clouds. When I looked up, there were laughing leaves. ""Leaves don’t laugh, I thought! Then I saw these giggling squirrels hiding among the leaves. ""The big squirrels gave me lots of nuts to eat. The little squirrels played hide-and-seek in my hair! ""We played for hours and hours. Until I remembered that I had to come home. But I didn’t know how to climb down! ""So the squirrels started shouting for help. You should have heard them! Kee! KEE! KEEE! ""Luckily, there was a purple plane flying in the sky. Can you believe the pilot heard their squeaks? ""She swooped down, picked me up, and flew me back home. ""And that is why I’m late, Ma. " "Tara! Stop making things up, " Ma said.“Kee! KEE! KEEE!”
