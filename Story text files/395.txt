It’s Rahah’s birthday next week. She’s excited about inviting her new friends to her party.“Who will you invite?” asks Mum. “You’ve only been at school a few months. The kids all seem so very different, don’t they?” “No, Mum. I have lots of new friends,” says Rahah.“I want to invite Zerina. She wants to be a ballerina, just like me!”“Oh lovely,” says Mum. “Let’s play some dance music then.”“I hope that Sikelele can come too. He sings in the school choir, just like me.”“Oh that’s good - we’ll all have fun singing too.”“Can we invite Susheela? She’s got fluffy kittens, just like me.”“Yes, let’s. She’ll have fun playing with our kittens too.”“And we must invite Yongnam. She loves pink cupcakes even more than I do.”“It’s lucky I’m making cupcakes then,” says Mum. “She can have the pink ones.”“Ah thanks, Mum! I can’t wait.” “Oh Rahah! I’m so excited to meet all your friends. They sound so special - just like you!”“But what about you? You love books, don’t you… just like me! Would you like to come to my party too?”Thank You!
