Meera and I are a team. She’s my most favourite person in the world. Do you know why? She’s the only one who can see me!Everything she likes, I like. Everything I like, she likes. Our names also sound the same. Meera and Ameera!Things that happen to her happen to me too. “I lost another tooth,” Meera says. While I lost another quill.Sometimes, we can be a little different. Meera makes up problems. I make them go away.Like the other day when it was raining— “Oh no, now we can’t go out to play,” Meera cried.But I had an idea! Off we sailed on a paper boat.Or the time when she started school. “What if I don’t make any friends?” Meera was worried. “You made friends with me. Now go make one more friend,” I told her.It’s my turn to tell the story now. Ameera is my most favourite person in the world. Do you know why? She turns stuff upside down, just so I have a different view.Ameera never lets me walk into a fight alone. Even though she doesn’t help much.She makes every day a BIG adventure. Like the time we had to get out of a murukku maze. “I know! Let’s eat our way out,” Ameera said.Like Ameera said, we’re a team.
