I love my teacher.She is a good teacher. She is kind and patient.She has braided her hair so nicely.She has put colourful beads in her hair.Her beads are green, white, red, and yellow.Mom, please would you braid my hair like my teacher's?When I am older I will put beads in my hair.I will grow up to be just like my teacher!
