Hashim loves mangoes. Every summer, Thamma makes pickle with mangoes. This summer, the mangoes are about to spoil.Baba tells Hashim that if he removes water from the mangoes, they will not spoil. “Germs cannot live without water,” he says.“How do we take water out of the mangoes?” asks Hashim. “Add salt to them!” says Baba.Then Baba and Hashim keep the mangoes out in the sun to dry.They put the mangoes in a bottle with some oil. Oil doesn’t let germs from the air reach the mangoes.“Baba, we have made Thamma’s pickle!” says Hashim.How can we preserve our favourite fruits and vegetables?Potato slice + boil + dry = potato chips (to be fried and eaten) Apple (or any fruit) + sugar + lemon + cook = jamTomato + salt + sun + oil = sundried tomatoes Lemon + salt = lemon preserves
