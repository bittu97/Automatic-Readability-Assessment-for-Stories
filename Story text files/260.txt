Farida goes for a walk every evening. She takes an empty tiffin box and a big water bottle.First stop, her kitchen. “Can I have some uncooked rice, please?”Two skips to the vegetable cart. “How many squashed tomatoes can I take today?”Three hops to the tea stall. “Any broken biscuits?”Four jumps to the beach. “I hope you kept the smelliest fish for me!”Five leaps to the potter’s shop. “Did you save me the chipped bowls?”Uncooked rice! Squashed tomatoes! Broken biscuits! Smelly fish! Chipped bowls!What is Farida planning?10Meow! Meow! A meal for the cats12Woof! Woof! Snacks for the dogs14Caw! Caw! Treats for the crows16Cheep! Cheep! Dinner for the sparrowsThere is nothing left in the tiffin box…. . . until tomorrow!A note on feeding neighbourhood animals If you decide to share food with the animals who live near your home, you need to think about some things. - Ask yourself if you can feed animals over a long stretch of time. - Choose an open space away from other people’s homes.- Try to feed them at the same time every day. - Feeding just once a day will help street animals keep the ability to hunt for their own food. - If you are going to take care of animals, make sure that they are healthy. Call the local animal hospital to give them vaccinations .- Some animals and birds such as pigeons, monkeys, or mice can become pests because of feeding, so do not feed them! - Water is just as important as food, especially in the summer! A clay pot will help keep the water cool. - Avoid oily, salty, sweet or spicy foods. With thanks to The Welfare of Stray Dogs
