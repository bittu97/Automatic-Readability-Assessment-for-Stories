Tingu Tiger is not happy with his skin. “It’s furry and orange with black stripes. I wish my skin was rough and grey,” says Tingu.Tingu Tiger likes Ranga Rhino’s skin very much. “Will you change skins with me, Ranga?” asks Tingu. “What fun!” says Ranga. “Let’s do that!”Tingu gives Ranga his furry skin. Ranga gives Tingu her rough skin.“Thank you, Ranga Rhino! I really love my new skin.” “No, no, I am Ranga Rhiger now. And you are not a tiger anymore.” “Right, I am a tino now!” says Tingu.Tingu Tino jumps, dances, swims, runs, and marches happily in his new grey skin.After a while, the skin becomes itchy, scratchy and boring.“I think I will get my old skin back. It was softer, smoother and more fun,” thinks Tingu. “Ranga Rhiger! Where are you?”“Ah, there you are Ranga Rhiger!” Tingu calls out. “No, no! I am not a rhiger now,” says Ranga. “I changed skins with Bubbloo Bear. I am now Ranga Rhear!”“I want my nice old skin back,” sighs Tingu. “Where is Bubbloo Bear?” “There by the pond,” Ranga Rhear points. “But Bubbloo is now a biger!”Bubbloo Biger says “No!” to Tingu. “I don’t want that rough, grey skin and be a bino!” Bubbloo says angrily.“But I don’t want to remain a tino!” cries poor Tingu.Bubbloo Biger has a great idea. “Let’s ask Rani Simmy what to do.”Rani Simmy roars and growls at them. “What nonsense, you silly animals! Change back to your skins right now.”“Ranga, give that skin back to Bubbloo! Bubbloo, give that skin back to Tingu! Tingu, give that skin back to Ranga!” The rhear, the biger and the tino do as they are told. They are back to being a rhino, a bear and a tiger.When Tingu, Ranga and Bubbloo go away, Rani Simmy grins to herself. “That was fun! Hey, Crocodile, let’s become a locodile and a crion!”
