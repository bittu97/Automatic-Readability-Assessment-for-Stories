BHAOO BHAOO!How does Simmi know so much about Lolo without looking? Everyone, including Lolo, sounds different depending on where they are.Voices become softer as people move further away and louder when they come closer. Voices also sound different when weâ€™re trying to be quiet or loud, and if we talk in a small, empty space or into a blanket.
