I kept it hidden, safe and sound, In my drawer of socks. I once had a dream, so small and light, I kept it in a box.This tiny dream, I had, you see, Was mostly about me …Space Selfie! … who I’d be, and where I’d go, And what I’d one day see.At first, it was a little dream, Until one day it grew, And so I took it out for air, To show my dream to you.And then my dream, it got so big, I had to let it out . . .I took it to the playground, And watched it bounce about.Then all the kids, they saw my dream, And said, “We want one too!” I said to them, “Ok, no probs.” And told them what to do. Wow! ! ! Awesome! What? ?“Well, first you think of what you want. Believe it with your heart.To get a dream as big as mine, This is the place to start.”“And once it’s big enough,” I said. “You’ve got to let it free To fly up high across the world, For all the world to see.”And at that point, my big old dream, Which once was in a drawer … Shook and climbed, Took to the sky …And soared . . . and soared … . . . and soared.glue here glue here glu e h ere glue here glue here glue here g l u e h e r e glue here glue here glue here Don’t cut it out!
