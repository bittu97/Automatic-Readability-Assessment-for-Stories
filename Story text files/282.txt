Lalita is the pet pig of Mini Singh the potter. She is a naughty pig and is always in trouble.Harrumph! Harrumph! Lalita pushes stones all over the neat paths.Harrr harrr harrr! She snorts and digs up the garden.Grrrrr grrrrr grrrrr! Lalita tears up all the newspapers. Even the one Mini hasn’t read yet.Phurrrr phurrrr phurrrr! She blows bubbles into her water bowl and spills water all over!Chapaak! Jhapaak! Lalita chews up all the lilies and scares the fish in the pond.“Lock her up,” says Mini's Aai. “Tie her up,” says Mini's Tai. “Never ever!” says Mini. “She never ever messes with my pots and jugs.”One day, Mini comes to work bright and early. He whistles happily to Lalita. “Harrumph, harrumph,” she grunts back.His happiness vanishes when he sees… Broken bowls, shattered jugs Cracked cups, smashed teapots Everywhere!Mini gets angrier and angrier and angrier!He ties Lalita up under the shady bougainvillea.Lalita doesn’t understand why she is tied up. She whines and whimpers. She cries and sighs. But Mini is too angry to listen.All day Mini works angrily and Lalita stays tied up. Then, Mini hears a noise. It isn’t a harrumph, it isn’t a harrr. It isn’t a grrr, it isn’t a phurrr. And it isn’t a chapaak or a jhapaak!MEOOWWW! CRASH! MEOOOWWW! THUNK! It is a large, orange cat! It is the large, orange cat that knocked over the pots and jugs.Mini unties Lalita. “Harrumph, harrumph,” she grunts. Lalita chases the cat. Round and round, and right out of the pottery!Then Lalita goes right back to doing pig-headed things. Because that’s what pigs do.
