Flippy once came to a eucalyptus tree"This looks like a fruit nice and juicy"And so she tried to take a bite. . . . But it wasn't quite right. . .Because it was a bud, not a fruit, silly!Now Flippy was tiny but she was really very smartTo sip nectar she could use her beak like a dartBut oh no! She went overboard. . . and she poked and she poked. . . .Until the bud burst open and gave her a start!Flowerpeckers are among the tiniest birds in India, measuring only around 8cm from beak to tail! The Pale-billed Flowerpecker is one of this family, and is heard more often than seen, with its 'tik-tik-tik-tik' calls. Common in South India, it loves the fruit of the Singapore Cherry tree! It squeezes the cherry with its beak, until the juice runs into its mouth!
