Lucy woke up. Her sister Thabi wasn’t in her bed.“Thabi’s in the kitchen eating breakfast.” “Where’s Thabi?” Lucy asked Ma.“That’s not Thabi!” “That’s a hippopotamus!”Lucy looked all over the house.“Where’s Thabi?” Lucy asked Pa. “Thabi’s swimming in the pool.”“That’s not Thabi!” “That’s a hippopotamus!”Lucy kept looking around the garden.“Where’s Thabi?” Lucy asked the neighbour. “Thabi’s playing in the park.”“That’s not Thabi! That’s a hippopotamus!”Then Lucy heard a funny noise. She gave the hippopotamus a big tickle.“There’s Thabi!”“Thanks,” said Thabi. “It’s very boring inside a hippopotamus.”
