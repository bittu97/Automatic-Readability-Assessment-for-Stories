Today is Beach Day! Naledi is going on the train for the first time.“Who takes the train?” Naledi asks. “Let’s wait and see,” Mom says.“Look, Mom!” Naledi whispers.“Hello little girl, do you want to say hi?” Naledi looks at Mom. Mom nods. “Yes please!” says Naledi.“Chocolates! Chocolates!” “Please can I get one?” Naledi asks. “We need to leave space in your tummy for the ice-cream at the beach,” Mom says.“Why are you wearing pyjamas?” Naledi asks.“We do karate.” Kapow! “Like this!”“Oh, look! A soldier.” “No,” Mom says, “that is a sailor. She is from the navy.”“Mom! Drummers!” “Listen, Naledi,” Mom says. “The drums beat to the sound of the train.”“Do you want to dance with us?” the drummer asks.“We are getting off at the next stop,” Mom tells Naledi who is now tired.“So, what kind of people take the train?” Mom asks. “The best kind,” Naledi says.
