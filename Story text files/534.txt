Rose came home from school with a new idea. “Appa! I know how to make compost!”“What is compost?” asked Appa, scratching his head. “Can I make it in the backyard, Appa?” Rose asked, tugging Rocky’s ear. “But what is compost?” Appa asked, scratching his ear.“It’s what plants eat, Appa,” said Rose. It makes them grow tall and strong.” “Baaaaa! Even I knew that!” bleated Rocky. Appa looked worried. “Oh! Don’t worry, Appa. We only need waste to make compost.”Off they ran to the backyard, and dug a hole. “Do you know what we need for compost, Rocky?”“We need lots of vegetable and fruit peels. See, we don’t have to waste anything anymore!”“We need lots of newspapers!”“We need dry leaves!”“And we need water!”“Where did everything go?”“ROCKY!”
