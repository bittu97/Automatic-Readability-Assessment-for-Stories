I see a blue butterfly waving goodbyeI see a yellow bee drinking a cup of teaI see a red fish in a dishI see a green frog playing with a puppy dogI see an orange duck wishing me good luckI see a violet flower dancing with a caterpillarI see a grey and black cat wearing an orange hatI see a grey and brown mouse hiding in a pink houseI see a red and black fox wearing purple socksI see a green grasshopper reading a black and white newspaperI see a black and purple goat sailing in a red boatI see a green and brown crocodile giving me a big smileI see a black and blue snake eating a slice of cakeI see a red and yellow hen writing with a penI see a black and orange tiger standing in the waterI see with my two black eyes all the colours as they fly
