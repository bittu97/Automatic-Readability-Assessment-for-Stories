Once there was a sun that rose below the hills. And a river that flowed right on top of the trees.All the kids swung by their feet. And their tiny noses were above their eyes.4“Akash, why is your story upside down?” asks Teacher. “It’s TikTik’s world. It’s upside down.” “And who is this TikTik and what does he do?” asks Teacher. “TikTik runs across the ceiling. Like this.”“Akash,” says Teacher, “NO ONE runs across the ceiling. They will fall!” “TikTik does not fall. He runs up the wall. And up the glass window. And across the ceiling. Over my head, but never falls on it."So tell me, Teacher, if TikTik can run upside down, why can’t I?” “Because, Akash, TikTik is a lizard and you are not!”“Because lizards have a forest on their feet. A forest you can’t see. A forest of millions of tiny hairs."The hairs push into every tiny spot of every kind of surface – wet, dry, slippery. "And CLICK! They help the lizard stick,” says Teacher.Akash has an idea! “Teacher, when I grow up I can make shoes that are like TikTik’s feet, with a forest of tiny hair! ""Then I can walk on the ceiling too. And make my upside-down world come true.”DO YOU THINK people could look at TikTik’s feet and invent some things? Things that stick with a C-L-I-C-K? Some things with a forest of hair on them?Tape that doesn’t feel stickyFilm posters that don’t leave marks on the wallPlaster that won’t hurt when you rip it offShoes for Babu who brings coconuts down from the treeNow, tape, plasters and posters stick because of a gummy substance. But imagine if they had a forest of hair like a lizard’s foot. We could stick them on and peel them off at any time!
