Aiman is a young girl. I am Aimanâ€™s school bag. I am her friend. She wakes up in the morning and gets ready for school.I watch her from my place in the corner of the room. I feel happy that I will also be going out soon.Aiman carries me on her back when she leaves for school every morning. When she walks fast, my heart beats fast too.I ride on her back till we are out on the street. In the school bus, I sit comfortably on her lap. Aiman just loves me.I meet many other bags on our way to school. We chat, sing and reach school, jumping and running along with the children.Aiman keeps many things inside me: colourful books, note books, eraser, pencils and her lunch box too. The lovely smell of food comes from her lunch box.All these things get tossed around inside me. Aiman keeps jumping with me on her back. She runs up and down. I am always with her.During the lunch break, she leaves me in the classroom. I feel lonely but then, there are many other bags in the room. We all chat, laugh and sing but I miss Aiman.When school is over, do you know what Aiman does? Oof, she quickly stuffs all her things into me! She wants to reach home as quickly as possible. I start panting because she runs very fast towards the bus.She puts me in a corner after reaching home and forgets all about me. I watch her from a distance.As Aiman is growing up, my weight is also growing. She finds it difficult to carry me on her back now. Can someone make our burden lighter?
