Sonu wore a blue shirt after his bath. Monu and Rina wore blue socks.Oh, we are all dressed in the same colour today! Come, let us see some other colours!Here are Dadi's red chillies, don't touch them!Aha, Bholu is cutting purple brinjals.Rani Didi has sunshine yellow lemons.Colours are fun to see. Now to eat something colourful too! Yummy! Should we eat a pink chuski?Or a creamy white kulfi?We can drink tangy green jaljeera.Or we can have sweet brown dates?But Ramu's guavas are the best.Green on the outside, pink inside, with pure white salt and red chilli powder!
