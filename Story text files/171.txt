Once, there was a ghost. He thought he was very scary.Every day, he tried to scare someone.One day, he frightened a savage lion.Another day, a giant elephant.The next day, a muscular wrestler.On another day, a police constable with a big moustache.He was fond of seeing people run away in fear.He couldn’t sleep until he had scared someone.One day, he fell sick. But he still wanted to scare someone!He thought of scaring a mouse as a mouse would be easy to scare.He entered the mouse’s home deep into the night. Mouse was sleeping peacefully.Dhhummm Dhhummm. . . walked the ghost. The mouse woke up.He shivered in fear and stammered, “W. . wh. . who is there?”The ghost said in his most frightening voice, “I…. AM…. A…. GHOST!”Mouse said, “Oh! It’s a ghost. I thought it was a cat.”The mouse pulled a blanket over his head and went back to sleep.
