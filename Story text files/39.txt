They began their journey to the rock.When they reached the rock, they pushed and pushed with all their might.After a lot of effort, the rock finally moved. Khan saw the water snake's precious egg!Khan stretched his hand out and carefully pulled out the egg.It began to rattle and shake! What was happening?Out of the egg came a tiny water snake. It was safe! The water snake was overjoyed. So were Khan and the other sea animals.Khan finally fell asleep, exhausted with all the excitement. The water snake carried him safely on its back.Khan woke up at the riverbank again. He saw his empty bucket filled with fish. Was it all a dream?
