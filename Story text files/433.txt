It's just like a party helium balloon, floating into the air when you let go.And, just like a party helium balloon, They come in all sorts of different shapes and sizesThe balloon pilot lets the gas cool to come down, and heats it up to rise.Airships are like balloons, filled with gasses lighter than air. This enables the airship to float into the air like a balloon.But, unlike a balloon, they also have a means of steering and propulsion. Airships are also sometimes called 'zeppelins' or 'blimps'Because of their complex design, and a poor accident history during their early years, there are only a few airships still in operation today.
