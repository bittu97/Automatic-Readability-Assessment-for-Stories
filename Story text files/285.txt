“Have you taken everything, Ajja?” Sujju asks. “Your cap? Your bag?” Ajja is ready for his evening walk.Ajja is about to step out of the house. He looks up at the clouds. Why is he hurrying back into the house?Ajja checks on the shelf above the window. He looks in the box below. What is Ajja searching for? No one knows! But everyone stays out of his way. Ajja hates being late.The bag seems more full than usual. Ajja empties it in a hurry. But whatever-it-is is not to be found.Ajja is getting more and more late. He shakes his head. He grinds his teeth. He grunts and tut-tuts. He hunts under the sofa. He scrabbles on the bookshelf over Chikkamma’s head.Ajja’s toes are in front of Dinku akka’s nose. AIYO!HABBA! Ajja disappears behind the door.He stops at the bottom of the stairs. He searches on top of the fridge. What could Ajja be looking for?He even looks near the dustbin! What is Ajja trying to find? Everyone runs far away from him.Sujju asks, “Ajja, what are you searching for?”And sends Ajja off on his walk. “His umbrella was with him all along,” everyone smiles in relief.
