Other books available by the author: Most books are also available as a colouring seriesAbout the Author Danielle Bruckert Danielle is a New Zealander living abroad, who now calls Africa home. Her chosen career is as a professional pilot, she has worked in a variety of aviation capacities from instruction to airline flying, and is the author of several aviation text books. Danielle started writing children's books as a creative outlet from the stress of her 'day job' and as a break from the sometimes monotonous work required for her professional writing. She began with the Mac and Dipper series, aimed at 5-10 year olds, inspired by two of her own dogs. After having a child of her own, she suddenly found she had a muse, an eager resource for test reading, and, by benefit of her age, an honest critic all in one. It was fun and rewarding to write creative stories which matched her daughters learning curve and a series of 'junior' books aimed at 2-5 year olds followed. Encouraged by friends and family, and already familiar with the self-publishing route through her non-fiction books, Danielle began publishing the books online so that others could also enjoy them. Because of her passion for children's literature and the role it plays in improved literacy standards, all of Danielle's own books are available for free download and may be used free of charge for non-commercial purposes.
