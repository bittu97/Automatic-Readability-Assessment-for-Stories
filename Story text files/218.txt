It's not easy being a tiger. Yes, tigers are beautiful and fierce.But tigers are also big and heavy. This makes it difficult for them to hunt for food.Out of every twenty times a tiger hunts, it eats only once.When a tiger moves through the forest, KHAU! KHAU! KHAK! The langur calls, just like an old man coughing! KHAU! KHAU! KHAK!AWOOOO! HAWOOOO! The barking deer calls, like a scared dog! AWOOOO! HAWOOOO!OOW! OOW! OOW! The spotted deer calls, like a little bird! OOW! OOW! OOW!The whole forest knows the tiger is here! AHUUUN? AHUUUN? The tiger wonders, where has everyone gone?
